In osTicket, customers submit tickets through the web portal, ensuring their issues are logged and assigned for resolution.

How to Submit a Ticket:
<br>
1. Go to the osTicket Portal and click "Open a New Ticket." <br>
2. Enter Details:
A Name & Email for communication, A Help Topic to categorize the request, An Issue Details (subject & description). <br>
4. Submit the Ticket – The system generates a unique ticket ID for tracking. <br>
5. Receive Confirmation – The user gets an email notification with ticket details.
Next, the ticket moves to assignment and processing.

To simulate urgent issue handling, create a high-priority ticket for a mobile/online banking outage and configure its properties: <br>
1. Open a New Ticket – Submit a ticket for the banking system outage via the Admin Panel or Customer Portal. <br>
2. Set Priority & SLA – Assign a high-priority level with an SLA ensuring a 1-hour response time. <br>
3. Assign to Department – Route the ticket to the SysAdmins or IT Support team. <br>
4. Test Role-Based Access – Verify that only authorized agents (e.g., SysAdmins, IT Support) can access or update the ticket. This process ensures critical issues are prioritized and handled by the appropriate team efficiently.

Had the customer agent reassign the ticket to themselves in osTicket and post a response in the thread, demonstrating proactive communication and ticket ownership. The agent informed the user that they may have found a solution and would follow up, ensuring transparency and engagement in the resolution process.

Emulated the process of resolving a ticket in osTicket by having the customer agent post a final comment updating the user and marking the ticket as Resolved. The agent communicated the resolution to the customer, ensuring clarity and transparency in the support process. This project demonstrates my ability to manage ticket lifecycles, provide effective customer communication, and finalize IT support resolutions within a help desk environment.
